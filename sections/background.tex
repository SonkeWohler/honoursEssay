    \section{The Necessity of Machine Learning}
    
      As is typically the case, there are many methods available to tackle the problem at hand. Machine Learning appears to be a particularly common suggestion that is used in a true myriad of applications \cite{}. Here I wish to give an overview why, in my opinion, machine learning is an unnecessarily complex solution to this somewhat simple problem, and how it will most certainly be applicable in later project stages, making use of information extracted by the methods presented here.
      
      \subsection{The Complexity}
      
        Talk about the unpredictability of learning. By definition ML allows the resulting software to be beyond what the human can predict. Justify this with references and distil into one thought.
      
      \subsection{The Alternative}
      
        This is basically simple physics applied to and integrated in software. It can be based on rigorous mathematics and hence reduce complexity and testing.
      
      \subsubsection*{Comparable Applications}

        also makes use of derivative \cite{}. Minor differences maybe? \\
        Very similar example of purely mathematical analysis that then informs higher level and ML analysis.
      
      \subsection{The Future}
      
        Have ML make use of this information and classify on a higher level. This way it can make use of rigorous mathematics, but fill out the gaps that are normally filled by human expertise. Additionally this approach reduces the need to teach the machine, and hence eases the way for good ML \cite{}.
