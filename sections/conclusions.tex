% CONCLUSION
\begin{document}
  
  
  
  Demmonsstrated that maths can correctly classify different phenomena. With Regression this can be extended to perfectly describe the underlying data.
  \\\\
  With this information available further implementation can build incrementally on this. I have suggested that it would be rather trivial to differentiate between noise and underlying physical changes once regression is implemented. This is the next ooobjective of the project.
