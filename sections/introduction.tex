    While a specific application has been kept in mind during development, in principle the resulting method should be applicable to any, or at least a diverse variety, of physical phenomena. Hence throughout this report a number of phenomena might be mentioned as examples for certain classifications that would seem unlikely to relate to many real world software applications. In all such cases, the diversity of examples should demonstrate the theoretical diversity of applications, even if eventually this method will only be used in a very limited set of circumstances.
