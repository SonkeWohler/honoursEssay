    \section*{Abstract}
    
    This BSc (Hons) Project aims to explore possibilities to automate the analysis of numerical data sets in order to extract higher level information from the data. It begins with low-level trace by trace analysis, attempting to extract classifications from the data that can then be useful for the next level of analysis. 
    \\\\
    While this is only the first phase of a larger project, the objective is to make use of the simplest and most reliable methods to extract information, by-enlarge with the use of calculus, rather than conventional classification methods that often involve Machine Learning methods.

  \section*{Acknowledgements}
    
    I would like to express my gratitude to Dr Ernesto Compatangelo, my supervisor, who has been guiding me through this project with knowledge as well as understanding.
    \\\\
    My thanks also go to my DidiLove who made me see this Project through in spite of many personal difficulties that I faced.
    \\\\
    Lastly, without the professional guidances from my coworker, Marcel Zack, would not have come as far as I have.
